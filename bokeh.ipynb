    "Axes: You can modify the axes by accessing the axis attributes of the figure object (p in the examples above). For example, to set the x-axis label, you can use p.xaxis.axis_label = \"X-axis\". Other attributes include axis_label_text_font_size, axis_label_text_color, major_label_text_font_size, and more.\n",
    "Title: The title of the plot can be set using the title attribute of the figure object. For example, p.title.text = \"My Bokeh Plot\". Additional title properties include text_font_size, text_color, align, and others.\n",
    "Legend: To add a legend to your plot, you can use the legend attribute of the figure object. For example, p.legend.title = \"Categories\" sets the legend title, and p.legend.location = \"top_right\" determines the legend's position. You can also customize the legend's font size, color, orientation, and other properties.\n",
